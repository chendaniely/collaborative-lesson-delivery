1. Keep 'em coming, we'll sort 'em out later.

1. Feedback, feedback, feedback!
   While teaching, constant feedback is important.
   Use this opportunity to see what works and what doesn't.
   Have students provide feedback (post-it notes?) and try to incorporate them as soon as possible.
   This allows students to be part of the community by providing feed back to a collborative lesson.
   Get them empowered, movitated, and started early.
